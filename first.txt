this file is used for documentation of the git practice commands and lessons

1. setting up git and github
    github profile is created in github and a new repository is created
    then git is set up in windows by downloading git bash in local system

2. cloning the created repository
    create a new folder in local system to clone the repository
    use 'git clone' command followed by https link of the repository copied from the repository UI in github

3. change directory to work in the repository   
    once git repository is cloned, use 'cd' command to go into the cloned repository 
    this helps us to work in local system and push changes into git
