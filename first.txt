this file is used for documentation of the git practice commands and lessons

1. setting up git and github
    - github profile is created in github and a new repository is created
    - then git is set up in windows by downloading git bash in local system

2. cloning the created repository
    - create a new folder in local system to clone the repository
    - use 'git clone' command followed by https link of the repository copied from the repository UI in github

3. change directory to work in the repository   
    - once git repository is cloned, use 'cd' command to go into the cloned repository 
    - this helps us to work in local system and push changes into git

4. pushing into github
    -whenever a file is modified in local system or a new file is created then commiting and cpushing the changes into 
    git is necessary as they help to transfer file from local to remote system
    - steps to follow(commands):
        1. git add filename or git add .
        2. git comit -m "commit message" - here commit message is required
        3. git pull origin main - this is used to pull all the changes made in the repository to make loca system be up-to-date with the repository
        this pull statment is very important in a collaborative working environment as the entire team uses same repository and the changes made will affecr in everyone's repository
        to avoid any over writing of files 'pull' command is used before a 'push'
        'origin main' is the path from which files are pulled into the system. this path changes when the branch from which the file has to be pulled is changed
