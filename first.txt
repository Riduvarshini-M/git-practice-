this file is used for documentation of the git practice commands and lessons

1. setting up git and github
    - github profile is created in github and a new repository is created
    - then git is set up in windows by downloading git bash in local system

2. cloning the created repository
    - create a new folder in local system to clone the repository
    - use 'git clone' command followed by https link of the repository copied from the repository UI in github

3. change directory to work in the repository   
    - once git repository is cloned, use 'cd' command to go into the cloned repository 
    - this helps us to work in local system and push changes into git

4. pushing into github
    -whenever a file is modified in local system or a new file is created then commiting and cpushing the changes into 
    git is necessary as they help to transfer file from local to remote system
    - steps to follow(commands):
        1. git add filename or git add .
        2. git comit -m "commit message" - here commit message is required
        3. git pull origin main - this is used to pull all the changes made in the repository to make loca system be up-to-date with the repository
        this pull statment is very important in a collaborative working environment as the entire team uses same repository and the changes made will affecr in everyone's repository
        to avoid any over writing of files 'pull' command is used before a 'push'
        'origin main' is the path from which files are pulled into the system. this path changes when the branch from which the file has to be pulled is changed
5. check branch
    - 'git branch' is used to check the branch we are working in

6. git status
    - git status is used to check the status of the working repository to know which files are modified, which are untracked, and so on 

7. rename branch
    - 'git branch -M new_branch_name' is used to rename branch name

8. git branch -a
    - used to get list of branch in github

9. git branch
    - 'git branch branch_name' is used to create a new branch in local system.
    - these sub-branches are used to keep track of one's personal work in a team. 
    - changes made in sub-branch using 'git push origin sub-branch_name' will not ne reflected in main branch

10. create and change into a new branch
    - 'git checkout -b branch_name' is used to create a new branch and switch into the new branch in repository
    - git checkout 'branch_name' is used to switch to an existinf branch

11. push branch created in local system to remote
    - 'git push -u origin branch_name' is used to push branch created in local system using 'git branch branch_name'
